# Lambda Calculus Encodings Lecture Materials

This repo contains materials for a lecture on lambda calculus encodings (CIS 6700, 2/5/2023). 

See [slides.pdf](slides.pdf) for the latest version of the slides (based on [TAPL](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/) Chapter 5, with some additional topics).           
See [questions.md](questions.md) for a list of student-submitted questions, grouped by topic.                    
I've (Ernest) tried my best to answer the questions in the bullet points prefixed with `EN`.
